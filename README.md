# About

It's true what they say - Bristolians are obsessed with their city. I grew up in Ukraine, and Bristol's moody brutalist buildings made me feel right at home. 

### The Challenges

I've never used Vue.js before, which meant curbing the more ambitious goals for the project in favour of ones I could achieve in the timeframe.

### What I would've liked to accomplish

- Turn the slideshows into components controllable by a single function (instead of repeating the same function twice in two different views). This would also mean the Next/Previous buttons wouldn't transition in and out of view when the user switched between feeds.
- Treat gallery data as components(?) for ease of update
- Use a CSS framework like Tachyons & Two.js to animate the background
- Make the slideshows scroll-activated (mousewheel & touch)
