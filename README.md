# About

It's true what they say - Bristolians are obsessed with their city. I grew up in Ukraine, and Bristol's moody brutalist buildings made me feel right at home. 

### The Challenges

I've never used Vue.js before, so even though I understand the principles, executing them was a learning curve.

### What I would've liked to accomplish

- Better modular breakup of parts (see below)
- Turn gallery parts into templates
- Control template parts using a single gallery function instance
- Treat gallery data as components(?) for ease of update
- Use a CSS framework like Tachyons
- Add animations to the slideshow
- Add a search view which would allow the user to create their own feed by quering an API


## Project setup

npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```

### Compiles and minifies for production
