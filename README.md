# About

It's true what they say - Bristolians are obsessed with their city. I grew up in Ukraine, and Bristol's moody brutalist buildings made me feel right at home. 

### The Challenges

I've never used Vue.js before, so even though I understand the principles, executing them was a learning curve.

### What I would've liked to accomplish

- Turn the two slideshows into components controllable by a single function (instead of repeating the same function twice in two different views)
- Treat gallery data as components(?) for ease of update
- Use a CSS framework like Tachyons
- Add animations to the slideshow
- Run the slideshow function after all of its content has loaded instead of loading each slide only when it comes into view


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
